# web_guesser
A very simple web application created using Sinatra (a lightweight framework for Ruby).

Completed by following this course: http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html . Which is part of the recommended Odin Project (theodinproject.com) curriculum.

Things I've learned:
-Basic Sinatra
-erb (injecting ruby code into html)
-Changing the css styles depending on the users input

What the application does is, it generates a random number between 0 and 101 and lets the user guess the number. The page color changes depending on how close the user is with his guess (low, too low, high, too high, correct). After 5 attempts the page generates a new random number and lets the user guess again.


There are a few things and bugs that might happen, might fix them later on, but I doubt it.
